lycopene34: Ortholog scan of ispA in pLYC72I 

What the project is about
The biology and context of the ispA gene
Why you chose your orthologs (biochemical rationale, functional hypotheses, etc.)
Any literature you consulted

The goal of this project is to do an ortholog scan of the ispA gene from the lycopene-producing plasmid pLYC72I and create the necessary files to facilitate the insertion of the orthologs found into pLYC72I. The ispA gene encodes the farnesyl diphosphate synthase(FPPS), which is essential in the MEP isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. This pathway leads to the production of biomolecules that are very important for survival, like cholesterol for lipid membrane structure or ubiqionones for cellular respiration. 
  
FPPS is responsible for the condensation of dimethylallyl diphosphate(DMAPP) isopentenyl diphosphate(IPP) to make geranyl diphosphate(GPP), as well as the addition of another IPP to GPP to make farnesyl diphosphate(FPP).
